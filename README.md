# CraigslistWebScraperASPNET
Selenium-based web scraper that displays information about Craigslist posts on an ASP.NET web application

This project was inspired by the desire to save time while browsing Craigslist. The process of clicking in and out of listings and reading descriptions can be time-consuming. Given a search and city, the program gets the title, date, and price of all listings in the area and displays them in a condensed format on a webpage to help users quickly find what they are searching for. This can be seen in action below.
